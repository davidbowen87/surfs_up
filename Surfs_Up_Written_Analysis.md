# Surfs Up Written Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis.

For this written analysis, we need to verify that the plan to launch and expand a surf and ice cream shop will be a good business venture in Oahu, HI for W. Avy. We have collected tempurature information for June and December through multiple years and have provided that information below. 

### June Analysis. 

While collecting all of the tempurature information for June across multiple years, we have recorded 1,700 tempurature readings for this assignment. 

* The minimum recorded temperature for June with the data is 64 degrees. 

* The maximum recorded temperature for June with the data is 85 degrees. 

* The average recorded temperature for June with the data is about 75 degress. 

### December Analysis. 

While collecting all of the temperature information for December across multiple year, we have recorded 1,517 temperature readings for this assignment. 

* The minimum recorded temperature for December with the data is 56 degrees.

* The maximum recorded temperature for December with the data is 83 degrees. 

* The average recorded temperature for December with the data is a little more than 71 degrees. 

## Summary and Recommendations.

There is not a large spread between June and December regarding temperatures for Oahu, HI. This is also not enough information to provide a recommendation to persue this business venture. I would recommend further analysis in the following areas before making a decision for this venture. 

* Analysis to include precipitation. 

* Anaylsis to include wind.

* Analysis to include population. 

* Analysis to include amount of tourist that go to Oahu for surfing.
